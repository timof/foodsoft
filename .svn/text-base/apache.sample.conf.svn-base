#
# apache.sample.conf for FoodSoft:
#
# You can use this as a template to set up a virtual web server for FoodSoft, and optionally phpMyAdmin and DokuWiki
#
# This configuration file assumes the following directory structure:
#
#  /htdocs/fc
#  /htdocs/fc/foodsoft
#  /htdocs/fc/phpmyadmin
#  /htdocs/fc/wiki
#
# It requires support for PHP and URL rewriting (probably mod_rewrite.so, unless compiled into the server).
#
# Note:
#  - you may insert the address and credentials to connect to the MySQL database below, or
#  - alternatively, you have to store this information in /htdocs/fc/foodsoft/code/config.php
#
# The first method is probably preferable as
#  - the password is not stored in the server-accessible file system (so it is less easily available to other virtual
#    servers), and
#  - you can host several foodcoops on the same apache server; you just need a separate <VirtualHost *> section and
#    a separate MySQL database per foodcoop, but you do not have to install several instances of the PHP scripts.
#
<VirtualHost *>
 #
 # host names to which this server should respond:
 #
  ServerName  fcnahrungskette.qipc.org
  ServerAlias fctest.qipc.org
  ServerAlias fct.qipc.org
  ServerAlias nahrungskette.qipc.org
 #
  DocumentRoot /htdocs/fc
 #
  AddDefaultCharset utf-8
  AddCharset utf-8 .php
 #
 # RewriteEngine setting is _not_ inheritable, we need it here:
 #
  RewriteEngine on
 #
  RewriteRule ^ - [E=server:foodsoft]
 #
 # all our pages are dynamic, so we set a default expiration time of 1 second
 # (may require special server configuration to actually take effect):
 #
  RewriteRule ^ - [E=expiration:1]
 #
 # map directories onto scripts (may be redundant with DirectoryIndex, see below):
 #
  RewriteRule ^/$ /foodsoft/index.php [R]
  RewriteRule ^/foodsoft/?$ /foodsoft/index.php [R]
  RewriteRule ^/wiki/?$ /wiki/index.php [R]
  RewriteRule ^/phpmyadmin/?$ /phpmyadmin/index.php [R]
  RewriteRule /robots\.txt - [L]
 #
  DirectoryIndex index.php
 #
 # make address and credentials for the MySQL database available to PHP scripts (via environment):
 # (alternatively, you can configure this in code/config.php, but the web server configuration
 # is a safer place for the password):
 #
  RewriteRule ^ - [E=mysql_db_server:127.0.0.1]
  RewriteRule ^ - [E=mysql_db_name:nahrungskette]
  RewriteRule ^ - [E=mysql_db_user:nahrungskette]
  RewriteRule ^ - [E=mysql_db_password:_YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD_GOES_HERE_]
